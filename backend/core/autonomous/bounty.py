"""
Kryx Bounty Track - active scanning of bug-bounty targets, safely.

In-scope is NOT enough: many programs forbid automated scanners. So a bounty
host is only scannable if YOU have confirmed (by reading the program's policy)
that automated testing is allowed - recorded in bounty_automation_allowed.txt.
The authz gate enforces this: in-scope + automation-allowed, or it's refused.

Findings here are black-box and TOOL-CONFIRMED (proven by execution), which is
what makes them defensible to submit - unlike reasoned white-box guesses.
